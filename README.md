## Fantasy consoles

## TIC-80 tiny computer

[TIC-80](https://tic80.com) is a fantasy computer for making, playing and sharing tiny games.
There are built-in tools for development: code, sprites, maps, sound editors and the command line,
which is enough to create a mini retro game.

## Lua Beautifier

To ensure proper indentation and make the lua code more readable I use the
