## Fantasy consoles

## TIC-80 tiny computer

[TIC-80](https://tic80.com) is a fantasy computer for making, playing and sharing tiny games.
There are built-in tools for development: code, sprites, maps, sound editors and the command line,
which is enough to create a mini retro game.

At the exit you will get a cartridge file, which can be stored and played on the website.

Also, the game can be packed into a player that works on all popular platforms and distribute as you wish.
To make a retro styled game the whole process of creation takes place under some technical limitations:
240x136 pixels display, 16 color palette, 256 8x8 color sprites, 4 channel sound and etc.
